## The dataset 
This dataset contains PSG players faces. It includes Kylian Mbappé, Neymar, Marco Verratti, Marquinhos and Keylor Navas. Images were scrapped using Selenium library on a Google Images. Once images were scrapped, we cropped the images in order to get the players's faces, as our neural network is able to focus on faces with good conditions.
